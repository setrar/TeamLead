Briefly reflect on the external environment and the specific trends (Leadership, Social, Technological, Economic, Political, Environmental and shifts in Values) that are shaping the future of your group, team, TeamLead class, Eurecom and future career.  You must bring all what you have learned together from the course to create a new, compelling, and consistent vision for your team and Eurecom's future. This vision includes a powerful new idea that must be aligned with the core elements of \"Who We Are,\" and related in some way to \"Where We Come From.”\n",
