    "Again imagine that your learning group/team has just received a research grant for the next 6-9 months. Briefly reflect on the external environment and the specific trends (Leadership, Social, Technological, Economic, Political, Environmental and shifts in Values) that are shaping the future of your group, team, TeamLead class, Eurecom and future career.  You must bring all what you have learned together from the course to create a new, compelling, and consistent vision for your team and Eurecom's future. This vision includes a powerful new idea that must be aligned with the core elements of \"Who We Are,\" and related in some way to \"Where We Come From.”\n",

    "A research grant in academia acknowledges hard work and drives innovation. While institutions like MIT and EPFL leverage their open-source projects (Julia and Scala, respectively) to gain visibility and funding, EURECOM’s OpenAirInterface (OAI) has untapped potential. The key challenge lies in visibility—without it, interest and funding diminish. Addressing this requires effective community management, a skillset that the TeamLead class is uniquely positioned to foster.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training future community managers, TeamLead class can attract young developers, engineers, and entrepreneurs to OAI. These managers can boost engagement through targeted outreach, social media presence, hackathons, and partnerships with universities, startups, and industries. Success stories and impactful use cases can enhance OAI’s visibility, creating a virtuous cycle: more visibility attracts contributors, enhancing the platform and drawing further interest and funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "With strategic leadership and community-building, EURECOM can position OAI as a cornerstone of open-source telecom innovation, fostering academic prestige, industry collaboration, and global social impact. The TeamLead class can play a pivotal role in turning this vision into reality.\n"

    "With 6 months of funding and with what we have leard in class, EURECOM can benefit from boosting OAI’s visibility and community engagement through targeted initiatives. A dedicated community manager and student ambassadors would lead outreach efforts, organizing virtual hackathons, workshops, and webinars to attract developers and researchers globally. High-quality promotional materials, such as videos, blogs, and case studies, would enhance OAI’s branding, while beginner-friendly documentation and certification programs would lower barriers for new contributors.\n",

    "Investments in GitHub infrastructure and public testbeds would streamline onboarding and experimentation. Partnerships with universities and industry players would foster adoption and align OAI with global telecom standards. Metrics tracking and regular progress reports would demonstrate impact and secure future funding. This approach would expand OAI’s community, elevate its visibility, and establish it as a leader in open-source telecom innovation."
